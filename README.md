# Layman Brothers

The Layman brothers banking web app is a the latest digital banking project to revolutionalize the industry, one Maker's Academy student at a time.

It was developed in Java for the Maker's Academy final project by Etienne Mustow, Joe Ingram, Keith Amoah, Marcus Rands, Nero Siva and Will Cabangon.

## Future features

Due to the short amount of time provided to put the project together, there were a variety of features that the team would have liked to implement. Firstly, we felt as if the styling should have been improved to a higher degree in order to reflect the skills we have obtained during the course, for example we would have liked to implement jQuery on the front-end to make the look and feel of the website more dynamic. In addition, we would have liked to add password encryption to mimic real-life banking protocols and some form of email confirmation on creation of a new account. Deployment to AWS was also on our agenda until we decided to prioritise the front-end styling as our deadline approached.Research was also carried out on fraud prevention APIs however, a decision was made to prioritise an MVP.

## Difficulties

Connecting a database to the Java back-end proved to be an arduous task due to the variety of issues that we ran in to. Being such a verbose language in comparison to what we have been used to, it proved to be a tough issue that we left far too late to solve. Similarly, we under-estimated how long it would take to style the website and left it rather late to finish. In addition our workflow could have been improved as issues with the controller and database caused unit and feature tests to fail on a  regular basis.

## Feedback

If we were to re-do project, I would suggest we take a slightly different approach. As we were a group of 6, we should have dedicated more resources to additional members to learn Java thus ensuring the back-end, controller and ORM were more regularly in-sync with one another. Often, one team member changing a certain feature would cause issues for other team members working on different aspects of the project and cause regular delays to work flow. Also, more team members and time should have been allocated to front-end styling to make the project more aesthetically pleasing.
